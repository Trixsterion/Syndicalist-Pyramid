**Author**: Oleksandr Kamyshkalo  
**Date**: October 1, 2025

## 1. Form of Governance
- **Type**: Syndicalist republic with elements of direct, representative democracy, and specialized voting.
- **Description**: A hierarchical system with power originating from grassroots syndicates, narrowing to a single leader. Specialized issues are decided by qualified experts with advisory input from non-experts. In peacetime, governance is bottom-up; in crises, it shifts to top-down with rapid online voting and veto power.

## 2. Distribution of Power

### 2.1 Syndicates (Grassroots Level)
- **Composition**: Communities (villages, cities, regional centers, capital), organized into syndicates (professional, territorial, or social groups).
- **Functions**: Discuss local needs, elect a Level 1 parliamentarian, participate in specialized or general voting.
- **Elections**: Direct voting (assembly-style), annually or biennially.
- **Example**: A village elects a representative; doctors vote on healthcare, all vote on roads.

### 2.2 Parliamentarians (Levels 1–3)
- **Composition**: Three-tier pyramid:
  - **Level 1**: Representatives from syndicates (1 per 1,000 residents).
  - **Level 2**: Elected from Level 1 (1 per 10 Level 1 parliamentarians).
  - **Level 3**: Small council (10–20 people).
- **Term of Office**: 1–2 years, with mandatory rotation.
- **Functions**: Collect and prioritize needs (via AI); develop projects; participate in specialized voting by expertise.
- **Election Mechanism**: Voting at each level among prior-level parliamentarians.

### 2.3 Supreme Leader
- **Composition**: One individual, elected by Level 3.
- **Term of Office**: 1–2 years, tied to a specific project.
- **Functions**: Make final decisions based on syndicate needs, specialized voting, and AI analysis.
- **Constraints**: Must publish reports and respect vetoes from syndicates.

### 2.4 Local Self-Governance
- **Structure**: Syndicates manage local matters (education, healthcare, infrastructure).
- **Powers**: Allocate budgets, initiate improvements, organize voting.

## 3. Specialized Thematic Voting
- **Principle**: Specialized issues (e.g., healthcare, engineering) decided by qualified experts (80% vote weight); non-experts provide advisory input (20% weight).
- **Mechanism**:
  - **Qualification**: Verified via existing databases (e.g., Ukraine’s Diia, LinkedIn) or self-declaration with AI spot-checking.
  - **Voting Types**: 
    - **Specialized**: Restricted to experts (e.g., doctors for hospital reforms).
    - **General**: Open to all (e.g., local infrastructure).
  - **Platform**: Online, blockchain-secured, with AI prioritizing issues.
- **Integration**: Results feed into the pyramid and leader’s decisions.
- **Example**: Doctors vote on healthcare (80%), citizens advise (20%); results inform national policy.

## 4. Checks and Balances
- **Mechanisms**:
  - Syndicates can recall parliamentarians or veto leader’s crisis plans (48-hour vote).
  - Parliamentarians oversee the leader via consultations.
  - Public blockchain registry for all decisions and votes.
- **Anti-Corruption**: AI audits voting; blockchain ensures transparency.
- **Crisis Mode**:
  - Leader proposes a plan; syndicates vote (24–48 hours) with veto power.
  - Specialized voting prioritized for relevant issues (e.g., military experts in war).

## 5. Elections and Terms
- **Schedule**:
  - Syndicates: Annually or biennially.
  - Parliamentarians: Rotation every 1–2 years.
  - Leader: 1–2 years, tied to a project.
- **Constraints**: Maximum two terms for leader; mandatory rotation.
- **Specialized Voting**: Conducted as needed, with modular implementation (starting with 2–3 sectors).

## 6. Unique Features
- **Syndicalism**: Inspired by Novgorod’s veche, with a streamlined three-tier pyramid.
- **Specialized Voting**: Meritocratic with advisory input from non-experts.
- **Crisis Flexibility**: Top-down with veto power for democratic balance.
- **Technology**: AI for prioritization and verification; blockchain for transparency.
- **Education Platform**: Digital app for civic training with gamification.

## 7. Economic and Social Policy
- **Economy**: Mixed, with cooperatives and syndicates driving local growth.
- **Social Protection**: Guaranteed education/healthcare, informed by specialized voting.

## 8. Implementation Plan
- **Step 1**: Publish on X, Medium, academic journals.
- **Step 2**: Simulate in a DAO with specialized voting tests.
- **Step 3**: Pilot in a Ukrainian OTH or small community.
- **Step 4**: Lobby via NGOs or universities (e.g., KNU, Kyiv).
- **Step 5**: Scale to new states or autonomous zones (e.g., space colonies).
