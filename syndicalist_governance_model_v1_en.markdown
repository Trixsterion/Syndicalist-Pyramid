**Date**: October 1, 2025

## 1. Form of Governance
- **Type**: Syndicalist republic with representative democracy.
- **Description**: A hierarchical system where power originates from grassroots syndicates, narrowing to a single leader. Governance is bottom-up in peacetime, shifting to top-down in crises.

## 2. Distribution of Power

### 2.1 Syndicates (Grassroots Level)
- **Composition**: Communities (villages, cities, regional centers, capital), organized into syndicates (territorial or professional groups).
- **Functions**: Discuss local needs, elect a Level 1 parliamentarian.
- **Elections**: Direct voting (assembly-style), annually or biennially.

### 2.2 Parliamentarians (Levels 1–3)
- **Composition**: Three-tier pyramid:
  - **Level 1**: Representatives from syndicates (1 per 1,000 residents).
  - **Level 2**: Elected from Level 1 (1 per 10 Level 1 parliamentarians).
  - **Level 3**: Small council (10–20 people).
- **Term of Office**: 1–2 years, with mandatory rotation.
- **Functions**: Collect and prioritize needs, develop projects.
- **Election Mechanism**: Voting at each level among prior-level parliamentarians.

### 2.3 Supreme Leader
- **Composition**: One individual, elected by Level 3.
- **Term of Office**: 1–2 years, tied to a specific project.
- **Functions**: Make final decisions based on syndicate needs.
- **Constraints**: Must publish reports and consult parliamentarians.

### 2.4 Local Self-Governance
- **Structure**: Syndicates manage local matters (education, healthcare, infrastructure).
- **Powers**: Allocate budgets, initiate improvements.

## 3. Checks and Balances
- **Mechanisms**: Syndicates can recall parliamentarians; parliamentarians oversee the leader via consultations.
- **Crisis Mode**: Leader proposes plans with rapid syndicate approval (24–48 hours).

## 4. Elections and Terms
- **Schedule**: Syndicates annually or biennially; parliamentarians rotate every 1–2 years; leader 1–2 years per project.
- **Constraints**: Maximum two terms for leader.

## 5. Unique Features
- **Syndicalism**: Inspired by Novgorod’s veche, with a streamlined three-tier pyramid.
- **Crisis Flexibility**: Top-down decisions with syndicate input.
- **Technology**: Potential for online voting and transparency tools.

## 6. Economic and Social Policy
- **Economy**: Mixed, with cooperatives driving local growth.
- **Social Protection**: Guaranteed education/healthcare based on syndicate needs.

## 7. Implementation Plan
- **Step 1**: Publish on X, Medium, academic journals.
- **Step 2**: Simulate in a DAO.
- **Step 3**: Pilot in a Ukrainian OTH.
- **Step 4**: Lobby via NGOs or universities.
